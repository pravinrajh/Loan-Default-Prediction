Loan Default Prediction 🚀
📌 Domain: Finance | 📊 Skills: Model Building, Data Preprocessing, Visualization

🔹 Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the risk of loan default for applicants. The goal is to help financial institutions make data-driven decisions about loan approvals, reduce risks, and enhance customer segmentation.

📊 Dataset Details
📌 The dataset contains loan applicants' financial and demographic details, including:
✔ Applicant Income
✔ Credit History
✔ Loan Amount & Term
✔ Employment Status
✔ Debt-to-Income Ratio
✔ Loan Default Status (Target Variable)

🔗 Dataset Link: Loan Data (Google Drive)

🚀 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
✔ Handling missing values
✔ Encoding categorical variables
✔ Feature Scaling (Standardization, Normalization)

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Data Visualization (Histograms, Boxplots, Correlation Heatmaps)
✔ Understanding loan default patterns

3️⃣ Feature Engineering
✔ Creating new derived features
✔ Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE

4️⃣ Model Building & Evaluation
✔ Machine Learning Models Used:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
✔ Model Selection Based on Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
ROC-AUC Curve
5️⃣ Model Deployment
✔ Built a web application using Flask / Streamlit
✔ Interactive UI for predicting Loan Default Risk

📝 Results & Findings
🔹 Best Model: Random Forest Classifier
🔹 Accuracy: 89%
🔹 ROC-AUC Score: 0.92
🔹 Key Insights:

Higher credit history → lower default risk
Higher Debt-to-Income ratio → higher default risk
